# Pong Clone - A Pygame Project

## Overview

This is a Pong-style game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The project meets all requirements for the final course project and demonstrates various Pygame concepts including surface manipulation, sound integration, file I/O, user input handling, and game state transitions.

The game features a classic 1v1 paddle battle where two players control paddles to hit a bouncing ball. The first player to reach the winning score wins the match. The game includes a menu screen, game instructions, win/lose conditions, and an option to restart or quit the game from within the application.
